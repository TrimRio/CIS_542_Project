Running tool to detect deleted files from a disk image

1. Download project folder to a local directory
2. Place new disk image in CIS542_Project/DiskImage or use existing file (works with .E01 or raw dd file)
3. Navigate to the folder path in a shell program (do we need to use wsl? do we need .fpwep library)
4. In shell: python main.py img deleted 
  

# Scan for deleted directory entries (looks for 0xE5 marker)
python e01_main.py your_disk.img deleted

# Or scan entire disk for file signatures
python e01_main.py your_disk.img scan

# Recover a specific deleted file
python e01_main.py your_disk.img recover <cluster> <size> output.jpg
